The goal of this assignment was to use Firebase to create a train schedule application would host arrival and departure data, retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js (to appropriately format the time). This website also provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

It includes a sleek, polished design and is user friendly.
